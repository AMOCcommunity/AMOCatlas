Array Format (Native / Original)
=================================

This document describes some of the native data formats present in AMOC datasets provided by different observing arrays.

In the logic of `amocarray`, we will first convert to an OceanSITES compatible format.  Documentation is outlined in the :doc:`OceanSITES format <format_oceanSITES>`.

**Note:** This is a work in progress and not all arrays are fully described.  The goal is to provide a summary of the data formats and how they could be transformed into a common format.  The common format is not yet defined but will ideally be able to capture most if not all of the original data.

RAPID
~~~~~

For example, at 26Â°N, the RAPID array produces an AMOC transport time series (volume transport in depth space) which is a 1-dimensional time series with a single registered latitude (26.5) and no registered longitude.  It also provides profiles of temperature, salinity and dynamic height representing individual locations (single latitude, single nominal longitude) on a vertical grid of 20 dbar.  Several locations are provided, with names like WB, MAR_WEST, MAR_EAST, EB.  So there are N_PROF locations, with N_LEVELS and also TIME as dimensions. And the LATITUDE would be ``N_PROF`` (a small number, like 4, representing mooring locations)

More recently, they have started providing a section of temperature, saliity and velocity which are then N_PROF, TIME and N_LEVELS, but now the ``N_PROF`` (and both ``LONGITUDE`` and ``LATITUDE``) would be on a regular grid--or at least with more locations (longer N_PROF), though it's possible LATITUDE would be a single latitude (26.5).

RAPID also provides layer transports which are single time series with names like t_therm10, t_aiw10, t_ud10, t_ld10, etc, which are between specified depth ranges.  These could be simply: ``TRANSPORT`` (``N_LEVELS``, ``TIME``) with ``DEPTH_BOUND`` (``N_LEVELS``, 2) to give an upper and lower bound on the depths used to produce transport in layers?  It would also need something like ``TRANSPORT_NAME`` (``N_LEVELS``) of type string.

Check CF conventions for standard names: https://github.com/cf-convention/vocabularies/issues.  Note that **standard names** consist of lower-letters, digits and underscores, and begin with a letter. Upper case is not used.  See [here](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/docs/guidelines.html).




Summary of RAPID files:
-----------------------

- ``moc_vertical.nc``:

  - ``depth``: dimension ``depth`` (307,), units `m`, type float64

  - ``time``: dimension ``time`` (13779,), type datetime

  - ``stream_function_mar``: (``depth``, ``time``), units `Sv`, type float64

  - **Convert to OceanSITES:** Here, we should change the dimension to all-caps ``DEPTH`` and ``TIME``.  Units on the streamfunction should be `sverdrup` to de-confliict with `Sv` for sievert. According to OceanSITES, the order of the variables should be  T, Z, Y, X, so the streamfunction should be (``TIME``, ``DEPTH``).  The filename should be something like ``OS_RAPID_YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD_DPR_moc_vertical.nc``. Here, we are using the ``OS`` prefix, ``RAPID`` as the PlatformCode, the date start and end for the DeploymentCode, and the data mode is ``DPR`` for derived product.  The additional text after is the original filename, ``moc_vertical.nc``.

**Key Products**:

- **Overturning:**
  - ``MOC``: time series (dimension: ``TIME``)

  - ``STREAMFUNCTION``: (``DEPTH``, ``TIME``) - this is the vertical profile of MOC (originally ``stream_function_mar`` in ``moc_vertical.nc``, note that this extends deeper than the depth grid in ``ts_gridded.nc`` due to the incorporation of an AABW profile).

- **Profiles:** ``TEMPERATURE``, ``SALINITY``, vertically gridded at mooring locations.

  - Dimensions: ``TIME``, ``N_PROF``, ``N_LEVELS`` (242,1)

  - Coordinates: ``LATITUDE``, ``LONGITUDE`` (``N_PROF``=5,) - these would be the locations of the profiles, which are current in the "long name" for each of the ``TG_west``, ``TG_east``, ``TG_wb3``, ``TG_MARWEST``, ``TG_mareast``.  etc. ``TIME`` in datetime.  And ``PRESSURE`` (``N_LEVELS``,) - this is the depth grid in ``ts_gridded.nc``.

  - Variables: ``TEMPERATURE``, ``SALINITY``, ``TEMPERATURE_FLAG``, ``SALINITY_FLAG`` (``TIME``, ``N_PROF``, ``N_LEVELS``).  Attributes would specify units and the version of temperature/salinity.   and specifying what version of temperature/salinity.   The flags would have an attribute describing what the values mean (e.g. "1=good, 2=bad, etc").

- **Gridded sections:** ``TEMPERATURE``, ``SALINITY``, ``VELOCITY``

  - Dimensions: ``TIME``, ``N_PROF``, ``N_LEVELS`` (13000, longitude grid, 242?)

  - Coordinates: ``LATITUDE``, ``LONGITUDE`` (``N_PROF``=longitude grid,), ``TIME`` in datetime.  And ``PRESSURE`` (``N_LEVELS``,)

  - Variables: ``TEMPERATURE``, ``SALINITY``, ``VELOCITY`` (``TIME``, ``N_PROF``, ``N_LEVELS``).  Attributes would specify units and the version of temperature/salinity.   and specifying what version of temperature/salinity.   The flags would have an attribute describing what the values mean (e.g. "1=good, 2=bad, etc").

- **Layer transports:**

  - Dimensions: ``TIME``, ``N_LEVELS`` (13779, 5)

  - Coordinates: ``LATITUDE``, ``LONGITUDE_BOUNDS`` (scalar, x2), ``TIME`` in datetime.  And ``DEPTH_BOUND`` (``N_LEVELS``, 2) - this would be the depth bounds for the transport layers.

  - Variables: ``TRANSPORT`` (``TIME``, ``N_LEVELS``) - this would be the time series of transport in layers.  This would also have ``DEPTH_BOUND`` (``N_LEVELS``, 2) to give an upper and lower bound on the depths used to produce transport in layers.  It would also need something like ``TRANSPORT_NAME`` (``N_LEVELS``, string) to indicate what the layer is (e.g. `t_therm10`, `t_aiw10`, etc).

- **Component transports:**

  - Dimensions: ``TIME``, ``N_COMPONENT`` (13779, 5)

  - Coordinates: ``LATITUDE``, ``LONGITUDE_BOUNDS`` (scalar, x2), ``TIME`` in datetime.  ``N_COMPONENT`` for the number of components.

  - Variables: ``TRANSPORT`` (``TIME``, ``N_COMPONENT``) -  This would also have ``TRANSPORT_NAME`` (``N_COMPONENT``, string) to indicate what the component is (e.g. `t_gs10`, `t_ek10`, etc).  This would be similar to the layer transport but without the depth bounds.


.. _array-osnap:

OSNAP
~~~~~

At OSNAP, we have variables like MOC_ALL, MOC_EAST and MOC_WEST which are time series (``TIME``), but these could be represented as MOC (``N_PROF``, ``TIME``) where instead of the three different variables, N_PROF=3.  This would be somewhat more difficult to communicate to the user, since LATITUDE and LONGITUDE are not single points per N_PROF but instead may represent end points of a section.

Variables MOC_ALL_ERR are also provided, which could be translated to MOC_ERR (``N_PROF``, ``TIME``) with LATITUDE (``N_PROF``) or LATITUDE_BOUND (``N_PROF``, 2).

Heat fluxes also exist, as MHT_ALL, MHT_EAST and MHT_WEST, so these could be MHT (``N_PROF``, ``TIME``).

.. _array-move:

MOVE
~~~~

MOVE provides the TRANSPORT_TOTAL which corresponds to the MOC, but also things like transport_component_internal (``TIME``,), transport_component_internal_offset (``TIME``,), and transport_component_boundary (``TIME``,).  This would be similar to RAPID's version of "interior transport" and "western boundary wedge", but it's not so clear how to make these similarly named.


Summary of MOVE files:

- **Notes**: Similar in structure to RAPID layer decomposition but naming is inconsistent between RAPID and MOVE.

- **Overturning:**

.. _array-samba:

SAMBA
~~~~~

SAMBA (Upper_Abyssal_Transport_Anomalies.txt) has two main variables which are (``TIME``,), named 'upper-cell volume transport anomaly' which suggests a quantity TRANSPORT_ANOMALY (``N_LEVELS``, ``TIME``), where we would then have again a DEPTH_BOUND (``N_LEVELS``, 2).

But the other SAMBA product (MOC_TotalAnomaly_and_constituents.asc) also has a "Total MOC anomaly" (``MOC``), a "Relative (density gradient) contribution" which is like MOVE's internal or RAPID's interior.  There is a "Reference (bottom pressure gradient) contribution" which is like MOVE's offset or RAPID's compensation.  An Ekman (all have this--will need an attribute with the source of the wind fields used), and also a separate **"Western density contribution"** and **"Eastern density contribution"** which are not available in the RAPID project, and are not the same idea as the OSNAP west and OSNAP east, but could suggest an (``N_PROF``=2, ``TIME``) for west and east.

Summary of SAMBA files:

- ``Upper_Abyssal_Transport_Anomalies.txt`` (``TIME``=1404)

Potential reformats:
--------------------

- **Overturning:**

  - ``MOC``: time series (dimension: ``TIME``)

**Note:** Check the readme to see what the relationship is between the upper, abyssal and MOC transports.


- **Component transports:**

  - Dimensions: ``TIME``, ``N_COMPONENT`` (1404, 7)

  - Coordinates: ``LATITUDE``, ``LONGITUDE_BOUNDS`` (scalar, x2), ``TIME`` in datetime.  ``N_COMPONENT`` for the number of components.

  - Variables: ``TRANSPORT`` (``TIME``, ``N_COMPONENT``) -  This would also have ``TRANSPORT_NAME`` (``N_COMPONENT``, string) to indicate what the component is (e.g. `RELATIVE_MOC`, `BAROTROPIC_MOC`, `EKMAN`, `WESTERN_DENSITY`, etc).

**Note:** It would be good to verify how these components should (or shouldn't) add up to the total transports.


.. _array-fw2015:

FW2015
~~~~~~

This is a different beast but similar to RAPID in that it has components which represent transport for different segments of the array (like Gulf Stream, Ekman and upper-mid-ocean) where these sum to produce MOC.  This is *vaguely* like OSNAP east and OSNAP west, except I don't think those sum to produce the total overturning.  And Ekman could be part of a layer transport but here is has no depth reference.  Gulf Stream has longitude bounds and a single latitude (``LATITUDE``, ``LONGITUDE_BOUND``) and limits over which the depths are represented (``DEPTH_BOUND``?) but no N_LEVELS.  It doesn't quite make sense to call the dimension N_PROF since these aren't profiles.  Maybe **N_COMPONENT**?


Summary of FW2015 files:
------------------------

- ``MOCproxy_for_figshare_v1.mat``

  - ``TIME``: dimension ``TIME`` (264,), type datetime

  - ``MOC_PROXY``: dimension ``TIME``, units `Sv`

  - ``EK``: dimension ``TIME``, units `Sv`

  - ``GS``: dimension ``TIME``, units `Sv`

  - ``UMO_PROXY``: dimension ``TIME``, units `Sv`

Potential reformats:
--------------------

- **Overturning:**

  - ``MOC``: time series (dimension: ``TIME``)

- **Component transports:**

  - Dimensions: ``TIME``, ``N_COMPONENT`` (1404, 7)

  - Coordinates: ``LATITUDE``, ``LONGITUDE_BOUNDS`` (scalar, x2), ``TIME`` in datetime.  ``N_COMPONENT`` for the number of components.

  - Variables: ``TRANSPORT`` (``TIME``, ``N_COMPONENT``) -  This would also have ``TRANSPORT_NAME`` (``N_COMPONENT``, string) to indicate what the component is (e.g. `EK`, `GS`, `LNADW`, `MOC`, `MOC_PROXY`, `UMO_GRID`, `UMO_PROXY`, `UNADW_GRID`, etc).  Note that some of these were just copies of what the RAPID time series was at the time.

MOCHA
~~~~~


Summary of MOCHA files:
-----------------------

The heat transports at RAPID-MOCHA are provided with N_LEVELS, TIME, and variables:

- Q_eddy

- Q_ek

- Q_fc

- Q_gyre

- Q_int.

Again, we have a situation where N_PROF isn't really appropriate.  Maybe **N_COMPONENT**?  WE should double check that things called **N_COMPONENT** then somehow sum to produce a total?  Then we would have something like MHT_COMPONENTS (``N_COMPONENT``, ``TIME``) and MHT (``TIME``)

But we also have things like:

- T_basin (``TIME``, ``N_LEVELS``)

- T_basin_mean (``N_LEVELS``)

- T_fc_fwt (``TIME``)

- V_basin (``TIME``, ``N_LEVELS``) --> is this identical to new RAPID velo sxn?

- V_basin_mean (``N_LEVELS``)

- V_fc (``TIME``, ``N_LEVELS``)


Potential reformats:
--------------------

So this might be suggested as a TEMPERATURE (``TIME``, ``N_LEVELS``) but unclear how to indicate that this is a zonal mean temperature as compared to the ones which are TEMPERATURE (``N_PROF``, ``TIME``, ``N_LEVELS``) for the full sections.


- **Heat Transport Components**:

  - `Q_eddy`, `Q_ek`, `Q_fc`, `Q_gyre`, `Q_int` â suggest ``MHT_COMPONENT`` (``N_COMPONENT``, ``TIME``)

  - Total: ``MHT`` (``TIME``)

- **Additional Variables**:

  - `T_basin`, `V_basin`, `T_fc_fwt`, etc.

  - These suggest basin-mean properties: ``TEMPERATURE`` (``TIME``, ``N_LEVELS``)

- **Note**: ``N_COMPONENT`` should indicate summable components if applicable
